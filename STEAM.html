        <h1>What is STEAM?</h1>
       		 <p><strong>STEAM </strong>is an acronym that stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. In addition to being individual school subjects, STEAM has become a class of its own where students can solve problems, work cooperatively, and explore creative designs and innovations in a MakerSpace. A typical day in a STEAM class can include things like experiments, engineering challenges, exploring robotics, project based learning, inquiry based projects, and passion projects. As stated in my <a href="index.html">bio</a>, I have taught STEAM for most of my educational career and would like to share some resources that I have used for teaching this innovative specialty.
