		<h1>Brooke King</h1>
			<h2>A Brief History</h2>
				<p>I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and am a product of Wake County schools, where I now teach. After beginning my career as a 5th grade teacher, I now teach a <a href="stem.html">STEAM</a> elective at the elementary level. I love STEAM education and I feel like I am constantly learning new things to pass on to my students.</p>
				<br\>
				<p>I enjoy reading, cooking, CrossFit, roller coasters, and spending time with my family and friends. I am currently reading <em>Chasing the Bright Side</em> by NC State alum, Jess Ekstrom. </p>

		<h2>My Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://nearpod.com/">Nearpod:</a> Nearpod is an interactive learning tool that allows teachers to transform ordinary PowerPoints into engaging and collaborative lessons. It has been extremely helpful during the Covid-19 pandemic since it allows all students to be on the same page (literally) and respond to each other in real time. It has other fun components, like VR, so students can explore the places they are learning about. I recently held a virtual STEM career fair using Nearpod and we used VR to explore a laboratory at NC State, a construction site, the International Space Station, and the GE Aviation facility in Durham.</li>
			<li><a href="https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education/">G Suite for Education:</a> G Suite includes Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Google Classroom, and more. It allows for easy collaboration and sharing of documents, spreadsheets, and slideshows. I enjoy using these tools to create hyperdocs, Bitmoji classrooms, and for data tracking in addition to their intended uses.</li>
			<li><a href="https://makeymakey.com/">Makey Makey:</a> Makey Makey is a fun tool that helps students learn about circuits and what items are conductors of electricity. The kit consists of a circuit board, alligator clips, and a USB cable to plug it into the computer. You can control any of the keyboard keys and mouse buttons using Makey Makey. My students have created games on Scratch then controlled them using Makey Makey and Play Doh. I have seen people create piano staircases and Dance Dance Revolution style games using buckets of water that you step in to press the arrows in the game!</li>
